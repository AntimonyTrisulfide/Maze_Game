# Maze Game
Basic Single Level Maze Game with MS DOS Graphics, will work on any computer running Windows, made using 2D Arrays and While Loop Logic, my finest piece of code till date (26-12-2023).
I have also uploaded the C++ Code for the Game.
To-Do Later -- Improve the Game whenever possible, add Maze Generation and new levels, maybe a key door logic or enemies?
